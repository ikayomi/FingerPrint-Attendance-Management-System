# Biometric Attendance System

This biometric attendance system is a time and attendance tracking system that allows staff or teachers to organize courses, manage students and mark students' attendance using their most unique physical characteristicsâ€”their fingerprints. It's built with computer vision (Python OpenCV), Flask and the MERN stack.

**NB**: This system has been built and tested with The DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 scanner only. It only supports Windows OS for now.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three sections:

1. `client` (frontend)
2. `server` (core backend)
3. `server-py` (matching backend)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally

1.  Clone repo:

  ```bash
  [HTTPS] - git clone git@github.com:IamGideonIdoko/bio-attendance-sys.git
  [SSH] - git clone https://github.com/IamGideonIdoko/bio-attendance-sys.git
  ```

2. Install `client` dependencies:

  ```bash
  make client-deps
  ```

3. Install `server` dependencies:

  ```bash
  make server-deps
  ```

4. Install `server-py` dependencies

    i. Create a conda environment

     ```bash
     make conda-env
     ```

    ii. Activate created conda environment

     ```bash
     conda activate bas_env
     ```

    iii. Install dependencies

     ```bash
     make match-server-deps
     ```

5. Create a MySQL database (eg. `bioattendancesysdb`)

6. Set up `.env` in `server` and update with neccessary details

  ```bash
  make core-server-env
  ```

7. Run DB migration

  ```bash
  make dev-migrate
  ```

8. Run DB migration

  ```bash
  make dev-migrate
  ```

9. In a new terminal, start `server`

  ```bash
  make core-server
  ```

10. In a conda activated `bas_env` environment terminal, start `server-py`

  ```bash
  make match-server
  ```

11. In a new terminal, start `client`

  ```bash
  make client-server
  ```
